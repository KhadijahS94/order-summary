## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned more about how to group items in a div
class and still be able to apply css to each item
separately.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.proud-of-this-css 
.music {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    padding-top: 20px;
    padding-bottom: 20px;
    background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    position: relative;
    align-self: center;
}


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me learn how to apply my css styles that I only knew about in theory. It is very resourseful for beginners.
